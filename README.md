#  Automated Coffee Machine Flowchart

This repository demonstrates how to design a **flowchart for an Automated Coffee Machine** using **Figma (FigJam)**. The flowchart visually outlines the machine's logic, from powering on and checking resources to making coffee and initiating cleaning operations.

##  Overview

The flowchart provides a clear and structured representation of how an automated coffee machine operates. Each component of the process is modeled using standard flowchart symbols (terminators, processes, and decision nodes) to aid understanding and clarity.

##  Key Process Steps

The flowchart covers the following operations in sequential logic:

1. **Start**
2. **Power ON** – Check if the machine is turned on.
3. **Resource Check** – Confirm availability of water and coffee beans.
4. **Prompt Refill** – If resources are insufficient, prompt to refill.
5. **Select Coffee Type and Size**
6. **Edit Order** – Option to modify the selection.
7. **Grind Beans**
8. **Heat Water**
9. **Brew Coffee**
10. **Dispense Coffee**
11. **Add Milk** – Decision point: whether milk should be added.
12. **Adding Milk** – If yes, milk is added.
13. **Serve Coffee**
14. **Clean Cycle** – Decision point: whether to initiate cleaning.
15. **Start Cleaning** – If yes, cleaning process begins.
16. **Cleaned**
17. **Ready** – If no cleaning is needed, machine is ready for next use.
18. **Power OFF**
19. **End**
